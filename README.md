Hello everyone!
Welcome to Revill. Revill is a tool that is built by students for students. We aim to produce flashcards that are made specificially for Hong Kong students, while providing features to assist with the 
process of flashcard creation. We hope through ReVill, we can help you refill your knowledge through revision. Currently, the project is contributed by two main coders, TeCN and Caspar9872.
We hope you enjoy browsing in our project!
